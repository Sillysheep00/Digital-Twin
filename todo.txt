strengthen hvac logic
1. allow user to choose whether to switch on heater or ac 
2. apply different hvac logic for manual configuration
    - when user switch on heater the temperature will keep going up
    (a different logic for rising or lowering temperature from the auto configuration)


Add a button and when click pop up page to view all the room temperature (maybe is better than current design)

Add a button and when click can view each room energy usage (maybe is good not sure but can try )

Debug
washroom 1 and 2 dont have hvac , so when select do not show the turn on, off and auto button for them
